I think the main points of the article are easy to understand, but, in my opinion, that is because they are fairly simple and repetitive. It seems like each paragraph is simply a reiteration of the fact that you need to plan before you do something. 
I'm not saying that's bad, as this is an important point. However, besides learning that, I feel like there is no other substance to the article. The author repeats different facets of the planning phase, like the fact that you need to speak to your 
customers and know your audience, but she doesn't exactly give you a hard answer on how to do that, besides the fact that it depends on the client. Also, I think she could have perhaps provided an alternative wireframing tool for those of us who are 
not Mac users. I learned from this article, but I also feel like there could have been more to it.
